LeafPHP is the successor of YafYaf PHP Framework developed back in 2012.

This project is designed for educational purposes, aiming to introduce students 
to the realm of web frameworks and the MVC model.

LeafPHP offers an alternative solution to currently complex frameworks that 
require substantial effort to become acquainted with the coding environment.

It has several drawbacks and bugs if it is to be used for educational purposes. 
It is not a normal project. Anyone interested in learning can download it and 
develop it as they wish.
